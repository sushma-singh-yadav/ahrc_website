							<h3 style="letter-spacing: 0em;">Our Recruitment Process can be categorized in three phases, namely:</h3>
							<p>Planning – Structure, Focus, Identity, Prepare.
                                    <br>
                            Implementation – Contact, Motivate, Evaluate. 
                                      <br>
                            Closure – Select, Offer, Candidate Joining.
                            </p>  

							<p>
							   We select those candidates, who fit in well with the company's plan. In order to find the suitable candidate we give prime consideration
							   to the company's existing business activities, business plans, work-culture, structures, systems and future plans. We concentrate on the job 
							   description, its key result areas, opportunities, career implications, location, salary and benefits.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							   The initial planning enable us in identifying the needs of both the company as well as the candidates, which further leads us in deciding on 
							   a search strategy to target on specific skills, education, personality and experience.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Mapping Exercise:</h3>
							<p>
							   During the mapping exercise, we performing industry specific desk and field research on companies and relevant people so as to identify the 
							   key competencies. It includes job title, principal accountabilities, key result areas (KRAs), 
							   authority to be infested, external / internal contacts, reporting procedures 
							   and supervisory relationships, working conditions / environment, job specifications, compensation package, location and other necessary details.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Long List Generation:</h3>
							<p>
							  The Field research provides us a long list of qualified candidates, who are worth pursuing. After this process, we start 
							  the search to identify the suitable candidates either from our own exhaustive database or by advertising for the position.
							  The implementation stage consists of several phases including, preliminary interviews, shortlisting of candidates, 
							  informal reference checks, client interviews and formal reference checks.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Preliminary Interviews:</h3>
							<p>
							   For preliminary interviews, we select the potential candidates on the basis of prior work experience, qualifications, strength and weaknesses and the 
							   ability of candidate to fit into the work-culture and ethics of the client organization. The potential candidates are contacted and interviews will be 
							   conducted to find out their interest and suitability. We deploy the necessary expert assessment after the screening of candidates by drawing up competency 
							   profiles through the most innovative proprietary platform. 
							   During this phase, our consultants keep on updating the client of the progress achieved.
							</p>
							
							
							<h3>Short List Generation:</h3>
							<p>
							The preliminary interviews result out in short-listing of highly qualified candidates. Confidential reports are generally prepared and 
							submitted in writing to our clients on four or five individuals, who fulfil the specified position closely.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Informal reference Checks:</h3>
							<p>
							We conduct informal reference check to verify the listed achievements and last few work experiences of the short-listed candidates. After this 
							phase, a list is handed to the client with our recommendations and assessments.
							</p>
							
							
							<h3>Client Interviews:</h3>
							<p>
							   After the informal reference checks, we schedule a meeting between the short-listed candidates and the client with proper travel arrangements and handling 
							   of reimbursement of travel expenses. The consultant asks both the client and the candidates for the feedback after every interview.
							</p>
